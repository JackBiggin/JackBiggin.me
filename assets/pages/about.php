            <p class="handwritten">Hi, I'm Jack!</p>
            <p>Right now I'm a <a href="https://ahc.leeds.ac.uk/courses/g856/digital-media-ba">Digital Media student</a> at the <a href="https://leeds.ac.uk">University of Leeds</a>, on my exchange year at <a href="http://uwo.ca">Western University</a> in Canada.</p>
            <p>When I'm not flying around North America, I'm <a href="http://thisislsr.com">Leeds Student Radio</a>'s Head of Software. I've done all sorts of cool stuff there - from building radio studios to developing in-house software and designing their rather nice website. I also lend a hand to Leeds Student Television whenever needed, as their tech has a tendency to break.</p>
            <p>When I am flying around North America, I'm often attending <a href="https://mlh.io/faq#what-is-a-hackathon">hackathons</a>. Well, that, or I've gone on holiday to NYC for the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">4th</span> 5th time.</p>
            <h2 class="handwritten">And now to shamelessly list some awards I've won...</h2>
